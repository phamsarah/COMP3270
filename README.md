# COMP3270
Intro to Algorithms at Auburn University taken in Summer 2021 with Professor Yilmaz. 

- Hw 1: Goes over time complexities, developing strategies for algorithms, and proof by contradiction on algorithms.
- Hw 2: Recursion trees, Substitution Method, Calculating Algorithm Runtime, Divide-and-Conquer Algorithms, Recurrence Relations, Inductive Proofs, Master Method, Backwards and Forward Substitution, and Geometric Series.
- Hw 3: Heapsort Algorithm, Quicksort Algorithm and Recursion Tree, Counting Sort, Radix Sort, Bucket Sort, Disjoint Sets, and Binomial Queues.  
- Hw 4: Breadth First Search, Depth First Search, Directed Graphs, Topological Sort, and Minimum Spanning Tree
- Programming Assignment: Empirical analysis of algorithms, involves implementing, running, and then analyzing the run-time data collected against theoretical predictions. Computes the complexities of algorithms with different orders of complexity to solve the problem of Maximum Sum Contiguous Subvector.
