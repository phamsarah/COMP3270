I certify that I wrote the code I am submitting.
I did not copy whole or parts of it from another 
student or have another person write the code for me. 
Any code I am reusing in my program is clearly marked 
as such with its source clearly identified in comments.

Note (not part of submitted readme): Yes, the program could have been written 
more efficiently, and yes I could have refactored... but Im tired and have senioritis bad. No, I do not follow these awful programming practices in the workplace, and you shouldn't either.
